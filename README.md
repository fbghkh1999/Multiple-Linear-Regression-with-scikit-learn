# Multiple-Linear-Regression-with-scikit-learn
 we will build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using Python. You will use scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper.   By the end of this project, you will be able to:  - Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn - Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE - Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
